> algorithmic steps
  1. predefined wordlist
  2. two word list to keep track of used words, points counter
  3. inital case - first generated word displayed
  4. for each input, checking game ending criteria, adding words to word lists to keep track    
  5. counting points in each itteration
  6. in case of game end - printing points
